Description: development files for kde4support
 This framework provides code and utilities to ease
 the transition from kdelibs 4 to KDE Frameworks 5.
 This includes CMake macros and C++ classes whose
 functionality has been replaced by code in CMake,
 Qt and other frameworks.
 .
 Code should aim to port away from this framework eventually.
 The API documentation of the classes in this framework and
 the notes at <http://community.kde.org/Frameworks/Porting_Notes>
 should help with this.
 .
 Note that some of the classes in this framework, especially
 KStandardDirs, may not work correctly unless any libraries
 and other software using the KDE4 Support framework are
 installed to the same location as KDE4Support, although
 it may be sufficient to set the KDEDIRS environment
 variable correctly.
 .
